# Monolith Release Zip Builder
# Creates per-engine release zips with "Installed": true for Blueprint-only compatibility.
# Automatically builds with optional dependencies disabled (MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD=1).
#
# Usage: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Scripts\make_release.ps1 -Version "0.10.0"
#
# What it does (per engine, UE5.7 in this project + UE5.8 in the FIVEPOINT8 project):
#   1. Sets MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD=1 (forces BA/GBA optional deps OFF in Build.cs)
#   2. Touches every Source/*/*.Build.cs (mtime bump) to force a clean recompile so the
#      incremental release build cannot reuse stale dev .obj/DLLs (issue #71 mode 1)
#   3. Runs that engine's UBT (-DisableUnity) to produce clean release binaries
#   4. Runs the full-unity collision gate against that engine (issue #68 defense)
#   5. Harvests that engine's Binaries/Win64, strips .pdb/.patch_*/sibling/.claude
#   6. Packages tracked files (ONE shared git ls-files copy) + that engine's binaries into
#      Monolith-v<X.Y.Z>-UE5.<minor>.zip with Installed=true
#   7. Runs the mandatory dumpbin hard-link import smoke against that zip's DLLs
#   8. Prints the per-engine SHA256 marker for the release notes
#   Finally: copies the UE5.7 zip to Monolith-v<X.Y.Z>.zip (legacy bridge for old updaters)
#   and prints the legacy Monolith-SHA256: marker (= the UE5.7 hash).
#
# Source users (GitHub clones) are unaffected -- Build.cs auto-detects at compile time.
#
# Non-redistributable sibling modules live outside this repo. The strip phase below
# is defense-in-depth for accidental re-merges into Plugins/Monolith/.
#
# IMPORTANT: ALL editors (both this project and FIVEPOINT8) must be CLOSED -- UBT fails
# with LIVE_CODING_BLOCKED otherwise. The FIVEPOINT8 Plugins/Monolith clone MUST be at the
# same commit as this repo's HEAD (the script asserts this and aborts on mismatch), since
# both zips ship the SAME tracked content (git ls-files from THIS repo) with only the
# per-engine Binaries/Win64 set differing.

#      x64 fine -- but that stray STDERR line is what bites under measure #3.
#   2. Redirect the cmd subprocess STDERR into STDOUT (2>&1) and capture to a log so any
#      real build failure is diagnosable from the captured tail.
#   3. THE ACTUAL FIX: relax $ErrorActionPreference to 'Continue' around the native call.
#      This script runs under EAP='Stop'. Under Stop, PS 5.1 promotes ANY native-command
#      STDERR to a TERMINATING error -- EVEN through a 2>&1 merge (verified: Stop throws on

#      gate, even though build.bat itself exits 0. Foreground/interactive hosts default to
#      Continue, which masked this for every prior release. With EAP relaxed, the exit code
