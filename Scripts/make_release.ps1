# Monolith Release Zip Builder
# Creates a release zip with "Installed": true for Blueprint-only compatibility.
# Automatically builds with optional dependencies disabled (MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD=1).
#
# Usage: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Scripts\make_release.ps1 -Version "0.10.0"
#
# What it does:
#   1. Sets MONOLITH_RELEASE_BUILD=1 (forces BA/GBA optional deps OFF in Build.cs)
#   2. Runs UBT to produce clean release binaries
#   3. Packages tracked files + binaries into a zip with Installed=true
#   4. Strips accidentally re-merged non-redistributable modules from source,
#      binaries, and the uplugin module list
#   5. Unsets env var (your next dev build auto-detects deps normally)
#
# Source users (GitHub clones) are unaffected -- Build.cs auto-detects at compile time.
#
# Non-redistributable sibling modules live outside this repo. The strip phase below
# is defense-in-depth for accidental re-merges into Plugins/Monolith/.

# name across two+ .cpp files in one module. With no concatenation they never
# collide, so -DisableUnity cannot see them. That is exactly how issue #68 shipped.
#
# End users build with DEFAULT adaptive unity. On a fresh clone the adaptive
# working set is empty, so everything concatenates (effectively full unity) and
# they hit the collision on first compile. To catch this class against the EXACT
# release configuration, we run a SECOND pass under FORCED full unity.
#
# We force full unity by temporarily flipping bUseAdaptiveUnityBuild=false in the
# UBT BuildConfiguration.xml, then ALWAYS restore the original (back it up first,
# restore in finally). We do NOT pass -DisableUnity here -- we WANT concatenation.
# We do NOT pass -Clean: flipping the adaptive flag already invalidates the
# makefile so UBT rebuilds the affected unity blobs, and a clean would wipe the
# precompiled Plugins/RLPlugin/Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor-RLPlugin.dll (requiring
# a dv restore afterward).
#
# A whole-project full-unity build also surfaces the host project's own latent
# collisions. Those are NOT Monolith's concern -- we filter the captured log to
# Plugins\Monolith\ paths only. Only Monolith-path collision errors ship-block.

#      "'vswhere.exe' is not recognized" to STDERR. vcvars still recovers and inits
#      x64 fine -- but that stray STDERR line is what bites under measure #3.
#   2. Redirect the cmd subprocess STDERR into STDOUT (2>&1) and capture to a log so any
#      real build failure is diagnosable from the captured tail.
#   3. THE ACTUAL FIX: relax $ErrorActionPreference to 'Continue' around the native call.
#      This script runs under EAP='Stop'. Under Stop, PS 5.1 promotes ANY native-command
#      STDERR to a TERMINATING error -- EVEN through a 2>&1 merge (verified: Stop throws on
#      the vswhere line, Continue exits 0) -- aborting the release BEFORE the $LASTEXITCODE
#      gate, even though build.bat itself exits 0. Foreground/interactive hosts default to
#      Continue, which masked this for every prior release. With EAP relaxed, the exit code

# Add new sentinels when adding new optional plugin integrations.
#
# GameplayAbilities removed from sentinels in v0.14.7: it's declared as a hard
# dep in Monolith.uplugin (no Optional flag), so the engine auto-enables it on
# Monolith install and guarantees load order. MonolithGAS + MonolithIndex
# hard-link GameplayAbilities and that's functionally safe under this contract.
# Migration to optional + WITH_GAMEPLAYABILITIES gate planned for v0.14.8
# alongside the StructUtils-cleanup follow-up.
#
# External optional widget runtime sentinel: MonolithUI must stay decoupled from
# provider plugins. Exact public dependency sentinels below catch accidental hard
# DLL imports before the public zip ships; downstream providers should extend
# this list in their own release wrappers.
